## Synopsis
This is a collection of my works from Data Structure course CSE225 at North South University. Throughout this course, we were supposed to learn several data structures using C++ Programming Language. 

## Code Example
I have tried to follow the best practices with the help of my instructor. 
Indentation, variable declaration and in later problems, function definition was implemented in appropriate manner to meet the standards.

## Motivation
The motivation behind these works are to learn several data structures and their versatile implementation. 
For me switching back to C++ after coding in JAVA for a long while was a great challenge. Hopefully, I am doing pretty well.

## Installation
I have picked up <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a> and <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">CodeBlocks</a>
to develop these projects in MINGW Environment. All you need is MINGW installed for your compiler support with a 
decent C++ IDE to edit these codes in your PC.
I will be providing further documentation while adding new stuff!

## License
There is no restriction to modify, edit or implement these codes.
