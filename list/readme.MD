## Synopsis
Initial implementation of singly linked list with Node struct and primitive data type (int) as value.

## Code Example
C11 Standards are followed along with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015

## Motivation
To understand the implementation of linked list clearly. I have started with dummy headed singly
linked list. Step by step I will be implementing doubly linked list along with
some advanced operations(Like templates & recursion) to take a deeper look.

## Installation
I have picked up Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 to develop these projects in MINGW Environment.
All you need is MINGW installed for your compiler support with a
decent C++ IDE to edit these codes in your PC. To run them in Visual Studio,
I have included the project and solution files too.
I will be providing further documentation while adding new stuff!

## License
There is no restriction to modify, edit or implement these codes.
